## AI Query

```
find mov file 001 timelapse mov in my docs screenrecords folder
how to create gif from this video
copy this gif to ~/hacks-llm-coding-challenge-agromate/docs/assets/ if doesnt exists crete
```

## Detailed Description

Warp AI assisted with various terminal operations including locating specific video files, converting them to different formats, and organizing project assets. The tool provided step-by-step guidance for:

1. Finding a specific video file when the exact path was uncertain
2. Converting a video file to GIF format using FFmpeg with appropriate settings
3. Creating directory structures and copying files to the correct project locations
4. Generating documentation based on existing project patterns

Warp AI was particularly helpful in suggesting the correct FFmpeg parameters for optimal gif conversion and detecting when the command execution was interrupted due to the file size.

## Advantages

- Contextual command suggestions based on current directory and recent operations
- Natural language understanding for complex file operations
- Intelligent error handling and alternative suggestions when commands fail
- Step-by-step guidance for multi-step processes
- Ability to understand project structure and maintain consistency
- Real-time feedback and explanation of command outputs

## Limitations

- Large file operations (like full video to GIF conversion) still require manual optimization
- Some directory permission issues required additional troubleshooting
- Occasionally requires rephrasing queries for optimal command suggestions
- Limited to terminal operations rather than comprehensive project management
